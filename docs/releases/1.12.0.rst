Translate Toolkit 1.12.0
************************

*Released on 12 August 2014*

general improvements, it also specifically contains needed changes and
optimizations for the upcoming `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org/>`_

Major changes
-------------

- Properties and DTD formats fix a number of issues
- Massive code cleanup looking forward Python 3 compatibility
- Important changes in development process to ease testing


Formats and Converters
----------------------

- Mozilla properties

  - If a unit has an associated access key entry then these are combined into a
    single unit
  - Encoding errors are now reported early to prevent them being masked by
    subsequent errors
  - Leading and trailing spaces are escaped in order to avoid losing them when
    using the converters
  - The ``\uNN`` characters are now properly handled
  - po2prop Now uses the source language accesskey if translation is missing
  - Fixed conversion of successive Gaia plural units in prop2po

- DTD

  - The ``&amp;`` entity is automatically expanded when reading DTD files, and
    escaped back when writing them
  - Underscore character is now a valid character in entity names
  - Nonentities at end of string are now correctly handled
  - po2dtd:

    - Now uses the source language accesskey if target accesskey is missing
    - Doesn't remove stray ``&`` as they probably ``&amp;``

- HTML

  - The HTML5 ``figcaption`` tag is now localizable
  - The ``title`` attribute is now localizable
  - po2html now retains the untranslated attributes

- Accesskeys

  - Now accesskeys are combined using the correct case
  - Added support for accesskey after ampersand and space

- PHP

  - Fall back to default dialect after adding every new unit
  - Added support for empty array declaration when it is filled later

- Android

  - Added support for plurals
  - Text is now properly escaped when using markup

- TS

  - The message id attribute is added to contextname


Version Control improvements
----------------------------

- Added support for Subversion ``.svn`` directories


Checks
------

- Added specific checks for LibreOffice


Tools
-----

- The ``pocount`` tool has now a better counting algorithm for things that look
  like XML


Mozilla tooling fixes
---------------------

- Added support to check for bad accesskeys in .properties files
- Now the Mozilla roundtrip script can be silently run
- Added a new Gaia roundtrip script
- The ``buildxpi`` ``--disable-compile-environment`` option has been restored,
  resulting in huge speed improvements


General
-------

- Extensive cleanup of setup script
- Some bugfixes for placeables
- Misc docs cleanups
- Code cleanups:

  - Applied tons of PEP8 and style guide cleanups
  - Python 2.6 is our new minimum:

    - Removed lots of code used to support old Python versions
    - Dropped custom code in favor of Python standard libraries
    - Updated codebase to use newer libraries
    - Changed code to use newer syntax seeking Python 3 compatibility

  - Updated some third party bundled software: CherryPy, BeautifulSoup4
  - Added document to track licenses used by third party bundled code
  - Removed TODO items. Some of them were moved to the bug tracker

- Development process:

  - Added a functional test framework
  - Added dozens of new unit and functional tests
  - Expanded the tasks performed in Travis: pep8, pytest-xdist, compile all
    files, coveralls.io, ...


...and loads of general code cleanups and of course many many bugfixes.
